        <h2>WEI HSU</h2>
        <p>Hi guys! My name is Wei Hsu, and I am from Taiwan. My major is software engineering. One of the hobbies that I enjoy doing with my family is going on hikes. 
           The picture that I am attaching was taken by Kelly Mountain Idaho, which is about 25 minutes away from Rexburg, Idaho. It was a fun hike that both my family and dogs enjoy doing. 
           It was a fun memory because we bonded together as a family while enjoying and relaxing right after the Superbowl this year. As for my dream travel location, it is Iceland, 
           because I really want to go on a long cycling trip with my family there to discover beautiful nature. I am married with a kid. The picture I am attaching are as follow: To the left are my son, wife, me, and two of our puppies.
           Currently, I am working as a Technical Writing Product Manager for a company in Utah. I enjoy learning and managing projects in agile setting. 
           One of the most exciting about my job is seeing projects coming together and working closely with my teammates. I lookforward getting to each of you, and thank you for reading my page.
