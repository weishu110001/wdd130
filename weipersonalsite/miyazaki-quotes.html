<p>Hayao Miyazaki Portraits</p>
<h2>Hayao Miyazaki 1984</h2>
<p>“You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.”</p>
<h2>Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
<p>"Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man."</p>
<h2>Wind Rises 2013</h2>
<p>“You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.”</p>
<h2>Castle In the Sky 1988</h2>
<p>"The creation of a single world comes from a huge number of fragments and chaos."</p>
<h2>Nausica the Valley of Wind 1987</h2>
<p>The concept of portraying evil and then destroying it - I know this is considered mainstream, but I think it is rotten. This idea that whenever something evil happens someone particular can be blamed and punished for it, in life and in politics is hopeless."</p>
<h2>Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
<p>"Always believe in yourself. Do this and no matter where you are, you will have nothing to fear.</p>
<h2>Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
<p>"I do believe in the power of story. I believe that stories have an important role to play in the formation of human beings, that they can stimulate, amaze and inspire their listeners."</p>
<h2>Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
<p>"To be born means being compelled to choose an era, a place, a life. To exist here, now, means to lost the possibility of being countless other potential selves.. Yet once being born there is no turning back. And I think that's exactly why the fantasy worlds of cartoon movies so strongly represent our hopes and yearnings. They illustrate a world of lost possibilities for us."</p>
