      <h3>Quotes From Miyazaki</h3>
      <h2>These quotes from Hayo Miyzaki often plays a guidence role in my life, and I hope as you are reading these quotes, think of ways how these quotes can help you during hard times.</h2>
      <p>
        You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, 
        but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. 
        Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation of a single world comes from a huge number of fragments and chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of portraying evil and then destroying it - I know this is considered mainstream, but I think it is rotten. This idea that whenever something evil happens someone particular can be blamed and punished for it, 
        in life and in politics is hopeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always believe in yourself. Do this and no matter where you are, you will have nothing to fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do believe in the power of story. I believe that stories have an important role to play in the formation of human beings, that they can stimulate, amaze and inspire their listeners.
      </p>
      <p>To be born means being compelled to choose an era, a place, a life. To exist here, now, means to lost the possibility of being countless other potential selves.. Yet once being born there is no turning back. And I think that's exactly why the fantasy worlds of cartoon movies so strongly represent our hopes and yearnings. 
         They illustrate a world of lost possibilities for us.</p>

      <h3>Laputa Castle In the Sky Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        Among all of the Studio Ghibli movies I watched, Laputa Castle In the Sky is  one of the greatest movies of all time, Castle in the Sky is an amazing movie and is very enjoyable for people of all ages. Though this film was made more than three decades ago and was Studio Ghibli's first film, it still rivals, perhaps even beats, other movies today in many aspects. The plot is very well created and flows smoothly. The sheer contrasts between the action and the pauses between the periods of action are astonishing. 

        But the most astonishing part of this movie has to be the soundtrack, which leaves me speechless. The theme song that plays in the opening and end credits, Kimo o Nosete is my nomination for the best Studio Ghibli song ever. Listen to it and be amazed! Hayao Miyazaki's astounding animation combined with Joe Hisaishi's breathtaking soundtrack produces a magical, awe-inspiring, and wonderful masterpiece. Castle in the Sky not only gives you a sense that anything is possible and a lot of imagination, but it also brings you into a whole new, magical world. 

        It is the world of the 1800s, when industrialization had just begun. Who would have been able to picture massive metal airships that could really fly, and much more amazing, a castle floating high above the ground? This movie really bolsters your imagination and teaches you a life lesson: everything is possible. Castle in the Sky is one of the greatest, if not already the greatest, animated movies of all time.
