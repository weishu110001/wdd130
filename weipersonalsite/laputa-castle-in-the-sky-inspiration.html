            <h4>Among all of the Studio Ghibli movies I watched, Laputa Castle In the Sky is one of the greatest movies of all time, Castle in the Sky is an amazing movie and is very enjoyable for people of all ages. Though this film was made more than three decades ago and was Studio Ghibli's first film, it still rivals, perhaps even beats, other movies today in many aspects. The plot is very well created and flows smoothly. The sheer contrasts between the action and the pauses between the periods of action are astonishing. But the most astonishing part of this movie has to be the soundtrack, which leaves me speechless. The theme song that plays in the opening and end credits, Kimo o Nosete is my nomination for the best Studio Ghibli song ever. Listen to it and be amazed! Hayao Miyazaki's astounding animation combined with Joe Hisaishi's breathtaking soundtrack produces a magical, awe-inspiring, and wonderful masterpiece. Castle in the Sky not only gives you a sense that anything is possible and a lot of imagination, but it also brings you into a whole new, magical world. It is the world of the 1800s, when industrialization had just begun. Who would have been able to picture massive metal airships that could really fly, and much more amazing, a castle floating high above the ground? This movie really bolsters your imagination and teaches you a life lesson: everything is possible. Castle in the Sky is one of the greatest, if not already the greatest, animated movies of all time.</h4>
